## The Problem

Mental health apps often suffer from feature bloat and friction. For individuals managing bipolar disorder, logging critical health data needs to happen in under 5 seconds—especially during high-stress episodes when adherence is most challenging.

## The Solution

SteadyLoop is a Progressive Web App designed specifically for stability tracking in Bipolar Type 1 & 2. It prioritizes **speed, privacy, and clinical alignment** over social features or gamification.

### Core Features

- **Clinical Scale Integration:** Industry-standard metrics mapped for provider review
- **7-Day Trend Visualization:** Pattern recognition for baseline shifts
- **Smart Medication Cabinet:** Complex dosing schedules with offline support
- **Complete Data Sovereignty:** One-click account deletion, zero data retention
- **Native PWA Experience:** Installs to home screen, works offline

## Design Philosophy

**Zero Friction:** Every interaction optimized for sub-5-second completion  
**Privacy-First:** Strict data isolation, no analytics, no third-party tracking  
**Clinically Aligned:** Built for real care provider collaboration
